# flutter_catalog

Getting started with [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) for a basic product catalog use case.

The goal of this project is to ensure we are able to have a Clean Architecture, with separation of concerns, dependency injection and unit tests.

It's based on : https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples/tree/master/bloc_library
